Hi, welcome to my repository.

These are some of my projects and code ideas that I have worked on during my time in college.
Here's a brief description of each one.

assignment2.c is a project from 1st year programming. It is a security authentication program based around a 4 digit access code. The code saved in the system is '1234'. The user is given a list of options and selects where they go from there.

realm.c is from our Microprocessors module in 2nd year. It's a little video game that we had to add our own effects to. We connected a breadboard with a chip externally by usb. The code only runs on a software application called Keil. Our lecturer created the bulk of the game, but I added plenty of sound effects (finally putting my music lessons to good use!) and visual effects with ASCII art appearing when you fight bad guy for example.

The other three (animatedDots, fibonnaci, and spirographArt) are smaller bits of code that I had fun playing around with to get them to work. I hope you enjoy!
