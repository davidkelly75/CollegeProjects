Hi, welcome to my repository.

These are some of my projects and code ideas that I have worked on during my time in college.
Here's a brief description of each one.

assignment2.c is a project from 1st year programming. It is a security authentication program based around a 4 digit access code. The code saved in the system is '1234'. The user is given a list of options and selects where they go from there.

realm.c is from our Microprocessors module in 2nd year. It's a little video game that we had to add our own effects to. We connected a breadboard and a chip externally by usb. The code only runs on a software application called Keil. Our lecturer created the bulk of the game, but I added plenty of sound effects (finally putting my music lessons to good use!) and visual effects with ASCII art appearing when you fight bad guy for example.

The other three programs, animatedDots, fibonnaci, and spirographArt, are smaller bits of code that I had fun playing around with. The animatedDots program creates a wave of dots across the screen (kind of like a flipbook would). The fibonnaci program counts through the fibonnaci sequence N times, specified by the user. The spirographArt program uses the Turtle library in python to create a design that looks like the shining sun.

I hope you enjoy!
